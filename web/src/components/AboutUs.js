                        <h2>About Islamophobia Australia</h2>
                        <h3>Catalyst for change</h3>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Islamophobia Australia was established in 2019. Our sole purpose is to provide Muslims of Australia with a platform where their voices are heard,
                           and the Islamophobia incident(s) they experienced or witnessed are recorded and published. </p>
                        <p>Our mission is to stand against the anti-Muslim prejudice seen across the nation and play our part in making Australia a safe place for not just the Muslim communities but for everyone. We want to show the real, peaceful side of Muslims to the nation, along with the hatred they experience for no reason.</p>
                        <p>One practical way of doing so is by publishing the incident reports we receive from people LIKE YOU who have the courage to play their part in stopping this cancer of hatred, devouring our society. Here are the types of Islamophobia incidents that you can report:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                •	Violent life-threatening attack on a Muslim 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                •	A physical attack that doesn’t pose a life-threat
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                •	Destruction of property resulting in financial loss
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                •	Hate speech or verbal abuse at any online or offline platform
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                •	Discrimination against Muslims in any type of private or public setting
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Islamophobia and Its Impact on Muslims </h2>
                        <br/>
                            <p>Since the inception of Islam, there have been people who hated Muslims on an extreme level. Wars against Muslims throughout history provide
                                a clear record of how wrongly Muslims are perceived just because they have different religious views. </p>
                            <p>Now this ‘war’ has made its way among the civilians in the form of Islamophobia. Keep reading the guide to know more about it.</p>
                        <h4><strong>What is Islamophobia?</strong></h4>
                            <p>You can call it the fear of Muslims, but that merely reflects the actual and horrible meaning this word has in the real world. The sheer hate against Muslims, leading to massacres of people praying peacefully in a Mosque of New Zealand by an Australian-born terrorist Breton Tarrant is the reality of Islamophobia.</p>
                            <p>Many people act on their urges to harm Muslims just because they have different beliefs from the rest of the world. These ‘urges’ and the ‘actions’ taken based on them are what Islamophobia really is.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 my-0 py-0">
                    <div class="content ">
                        <h4><strong>Where Did Islamophobia Come From?</strong></h4>
                            <p>The term was introduced in 1991 by Runnymede Trust Report and was defined as the baseless hostility towards the Muslims, leading to fear and dislike of virtually all Muslims. Although this notion was given name in 1991, the groundless hatred against Muslims has been going on for centuries, especially in Western settings.</p>                        
                            <p>Furthermore, media plays a crucial role in brainwashing the people of Europe and some Asian countries against the ‘dangers’ the world is facing because of Muslims. </p>
                            <p>Plus, the keyboard warriors throughout social media also spew hatred against Muslims from time to time, leading to an increase in Islamophobia and the dangers Muslims face because of it.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Common Dangers of Islamophobia Faced By Muslims:</strong></h4>

                            <p>Muslims throughout the world face groundless accusations and hatred for practicing Islam - the religion of peace. There are already reports of countless hate-crimes against Muslims in Australia just because of the misconceptions people have against this beautiful religion.
